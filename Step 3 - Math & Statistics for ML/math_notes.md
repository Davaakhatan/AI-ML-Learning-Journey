# ðŸ§® Step 3 - Math & Statistics for ML

---

## âœ… Mean, Median, Mode
- **Mean:** Average value.
- **Median:** Middle value when data is sorted.
- **Mode:** Most frequent value.

---

## âœ… Variance & Standard Deviation
- **Variance:** How spread out the data is.
- **Standard Deviation:** Square root of variance (easier to interpret).

---

## âœ… Correlation & Covariance
- **Correlation:** Measures relationship between two variables (range -1 to 1).
- **Covariance:** Measures how two variables change together (no fixed range).

---

## âœ… Linear Algebra Basics
- **Vector:** List of numbers (e.g., feature vector).
- **Matrix:** Table of numbers (used for datasets).
- **Dot Product:** Key math in neural networks.
- **Transpose:** Flip rows and columns.

---

## âœ… Probability Basics
- Probability of Event A = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes)

---

## âœ… Normal Distribution
- Bell curve (data tends to cluster around mean).

---

## âœ… Z-Score (for Outlier Detection)
- Z = (X - Mean) / Standard Deviation
- Higher Z means farther from mean (possible outlier).

---

âœ… This is all the math you need to survive 80% of ML work!
